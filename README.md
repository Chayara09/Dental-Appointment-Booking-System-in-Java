# Dental-Appointment-Booking-System-in-Java
This is my very first project of using java 

This project focuses on creating a straightforward and functional system to book dental appointments. It allows patients to input their name, appointment date, and time, and choose from a predefined list of treatments, each with a specific price. The system automatically calculates the total cost by adding a fixed RM 5 administrative fee.

The application is built using Java and uses simple techniques like arrays to store treatment options and their prices, loops to display the menu, and conditional statements for validating user input. It is a standalone program with a text-based interface, designed to run locally without requiring external dependencies.

The current scope is limited to small clinics that need a quick and reliable way to manage appointments. While it doesn’t include features like database storage or multi-user functionality, the design makes it easy to add these later. It’s a starting point for automating tasks that are typically done manually, saving time and reducing errors in daily clinic operations.
